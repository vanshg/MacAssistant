***NOTE: I've currently hit the API limit. In the meantime, you can use your own OAuth credentials by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/vanshg/MacAssistant#Use-your-own-OAuth-Credentials).***

A project that integrates the Google Assistant into macOS, using the Google Assistant SDK.

*Google Assistant “is now on over 500 million devices”  - Scott Huffman @ Google I/O 2018*

MacAssistant can bring that number to 600 million

## Build Instructions
MacAssistant is built using Swift 4 and Xcode 9.1

Clone the project using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/vanshg/MacAssistant.git` (This project relies on some submodules to work)

Once cloned, `cd` into the `grpc-swift` directory, and run `make`.

You should then be able to open the `MacAssistant.xcworkspace` file (not `xcproject`!)

You will also need OAuth credentials from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com). In order to get them, you'll need to create a new project and enable the Google Assistant API for that project. Then, generate an OAuth credential, and select the application type of `Other UI`. State that you will be using `User Data`, and then download the json file. Finally, rename the file to `google_oauth.json` and place it in your project (*/MacAssistant/Config/google_oauth.json*).

## Use your own OAuth Credentials
Follow the final step of the Build Instructions to get your `google_oauth.json`. Then download [MacAssistant](https://github.com/vanshg/MacAssistant/releases/download/0.2/MacAssistant.zip), unzip the file, and right click the app to `Show Package Contents`. Next, go to `Contents`, `Resources`, and replace the `google_oauth.json` file with your own.
